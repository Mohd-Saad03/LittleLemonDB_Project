# 🍋 LittleLemonDB Project - Database Capstone

This repository contains the **Capstone Project** for **Little Lemon**, a restaurant database system.  
It demonstrates end-to-end database design, querying, and visualization skills using **MySQL, Python, and Tableau**.

---

## 📊 Project Overview
The LittleLemonDB project focuses on building and analyzing a database for a restaurant.  
The goals of this project are:
- To design a relational database schema and ER model for restaurant data.
- To insert and manage sample data for orders, customers, and bookings.
- To run SQL queries (including joins, procedures, subqueries, and triggers) for insights.
- To connect Python with MySQL and perform queries programmatically via Jupyter Notebook.
- To visualize sales and customer trends using Tableau dashboards.
